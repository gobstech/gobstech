- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @gobstech!
- Iâ€™m interested in always bring technology to make people's lifes easier.
- Iâ€™m a college student (18 years) and I'm studying to get into university.
- I would like to work on a new project of an app or of a website, but I'm to busy at the moment and I can't get time to work on new things...
- But, fortunately, there are some repositories here in GitHub of what GOB Tech did with less than two years of experience! So, please, take a look at my projects here at GitHub!
- ðŸ“« How to contact me: https://gobstech.github.io, email gabwebdev532@gmail.com or Instagram @gobstech.
- Have a nice day! =D
